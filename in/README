The file must have the following format :

Kh = value of the horizontal diffusivity
Kv1 = value of the vertical diffusivity in the zone y >= y0
Kv2 = value of the vertical diffusivity in the zone y < y0, z < z0
Kv3 = value of the vertical diffusivity in the zone y < y0, z >= z0
H = Depth of the ocean
L = Meridional length of the domain
y0Prime = adimensionnal y0 (= y0/L)
z0Prime = adimensionnal z0 (= z0/L)
Psi = parameter Psi
Nloc = for studyCaseTrajectories/Concentration, useful is you want Nloc particles starting at the same location
nyloc = for studyCaseTransitionProbabilities, nyloc x nzloc particles are initially released in each box.
nzloc = the initial positions of those particles are defined by the nybox x nzbox subgrid.
nboxy = number of boxes in the y-direction (for studyCaseTransitionProbability)
nboxz = number of boxes in the z-direction (for studyCaseTransitionProbability)
dt = time-step
T = final time
